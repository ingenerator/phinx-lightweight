# :axe: phinx-lightweight :axe: (VERY) Simple PHP Database Migrations

### DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE WITHOUT READING THIS

Forked from cakephp/phinx at v0.9.3 to produce a very lightweight version, compatible with current versions of PHP, without dependencies on most of cakephp. Except for MySQL / PDO all other database drivers have been removed.

**Check out https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/phinx.html ([EN](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/phinx.html), [ZH](https://tsy12321.gitbooks.io/phinx-doc/)) for the comprehensive documentation.**
